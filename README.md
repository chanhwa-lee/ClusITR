# Individualized Treatment Rule under Clustered Interference

## Replication code for Zhang & Imai (2023)[https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02467]

Mixed Integer Linear Programming to find optimal ITR under Clustered Interference

## Future direction

- Extension to survival setting (right censored outcome) + observational study (unknown propensity)
- Find DGP with semiparametric heterogeneous additive outcome model assumption
  
  $$ E[T_{ij}|A_i,X_i] = g_j^{(0)}(X_i) + \sum_k g_j^{(k)}(X_i) A_{ik} $$

- For this, $g_j^{(k)}(X_i)$ should be positive
